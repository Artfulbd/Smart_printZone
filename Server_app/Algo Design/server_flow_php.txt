# API call 1
	- php server will take it as a punch.
	- check if user is active and has files to be printd
	  SELECT status, pending FROM `_user711qd9m` WHERE id = 1722231

	- if active, than get total page count for printing.
	  SELECT sum(pg_count) as "total_page_count" FROM `_pending5cq71rd` WHERE id = 172127;

	- if doesn't has files or id deactivated, ##reply to abort printing##.

	##start transaction
	- if has files and active, than checks for least busy printer from "printer_status"
	  SELECT * FROM `printe3242342r_status234232077` left join print43er_details234c23452

	- will get p_id, u_id, required_time, time_one_pg, printer_name, port, driver_name
	- get current queue size
	  SELECT count(*) as "queue_size" FROM `prin23422ting_queue21314`;	
	- now calculate own printing time 
		-- own_printing_time = [(total_page_count * time_one_pg) + padding]

	- if required_time is zero means printer is idol
		-- than make entry to that user to "printer_status"

		-- wait_time = padding

	- if required time is NOT zero, means printer is printing, requires some time to be free
		-- than update time for that printer in "printer_status"

	- reply printer details with wait_time
